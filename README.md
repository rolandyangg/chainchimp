# Inspiration

Currently there are many problems in the supply chain management ecosystem:

- Traceability - Beyond the direct contact of two parties, it is often difficult to trace back the origins of a product. If your table is defective, is it the manufacturer's fault for the design or the supplier's fault for supplying poor materials?
- Trust - How do you know what you are receiving is actually what you asked for? Although document tampering is unethical, it is never impossible. There could be errors between transactions, and some shipments may try to cut corners...
- Labor - Performing transactions themselves take a lot of work. Often there is middlemen, a lot of paperwork, and other busy work that goes into a singular transaction.

To remedy these many issues we propose the usage of a blockchain to create a decentralized (traceability) application that mimics the supply chain management system!
Using blockchain will allow us to have an immutable public ledger record of all transactions for a product, and thus create transparency, trace, and traceability across supply chains.

# What It Does

# How It Was Made

# How to Run It

Clone the repository onto your computer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rolandyangg/chainchimp.git
```

## Frontend

Currently we do not have our website deployed.

cd into the client

```bash
cd client
```

Install all necessary packages

```bash
npm install
```

Run a local server

```bash
npm run start
```

## Backend

If you want to deploy your own version of our smart contract

cd into the dApp folder

```bash
cd supplychaindapp
```

Install all necessary packages

```bash
npm install
```

Deploy the smart contract, connect your wallet with thirdweb and follow the instructions they give

```bash
